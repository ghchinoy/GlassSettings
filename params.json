{"name":"GlassSettings","tagline":"A library to create a preference screen on Google Glass for GDK apps","body":"GlassSettings\r\n=========\r\nBy Victor Kaiser-Pendergrast\r\n\r\n## About ##\r\nGlassSettings is an easy to use library for the Google Glass GDK that let's you build a simple preference Activity.\r\n\r\nThere are ready-made preferences for toggles and for multiple-choice items, but you can easily add your own by simply extending the `AbstractPreference` class.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How To Use ##\r\n\r\nYou can see a demo application [here](https://github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/tree/master/Demo). All of the interesting code takes place in [MainActivity](https://github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/blob/master/Demo/src/com/example/glasssettingsdemo/MainActivity.java)\r\n\r\nSteps to use\r\n  1. Create an Activity that extends `GlassPreferenceActivity`\r\n  2. In `OnCreate`, add as many preferences as you want with `addTogglePreference`, `addChoicePreference`, `addActivityPreference`, `addHeadTiltPreference` or use `addPreference` with your own custom preference (that extends `AbstractPreference`).\r\n  3. Call `buildAndShowOptions()` at the end of `onCreate` to show all your preferences\r\n\r\n## Preference Types ##\r\nGlassSettings provides three Preference types that are completely ready for use with no additional setup:\r\n 1. TogglePreference\r\n  - A simple Preference that can be on or off\r\n 2. ChooserPreference\r\n  - A Preference that gives the user a list to choose from\r\n  - Lists of options can be easily assembled with the `OptionsBuilder` class (see the Demo source)\r\n 3. HeadTiltPreference\r\n  - A Preference that uses the accelerometer to let the user pick the amount of up/down tilt of Glass\r\n  - Note that this Preference does not store an angle, but rather acceleration in meters/second<sup>2</sup> in Glass's Z axis\r\n  - In order to use this Preference, you will have to define an Activity in AndroidManifest.xml:\r\n\r\n\r\n        <activity\r\n            android:enabled=\"true\"\r\n            android:exported=\"true\"\r\n            android:name=\"com.victor.kaiser.pendergrast.settings.types.activity.HeadTiltPreferenceActivity\"\r\n            android:label=\"@string/title_activity_glass_preference\" >\r\n        </activity>\r\n\r\nIn addition to those three completely packaged Preferences, there are two additional that let custom experiences be created\r\n 1. ActivityPreference\r\n  - Launches an Activity when tapped\r\n  - The Preference's key is passed in as an extra with the key `\"preference_key\"`, and can be retrieved with `getIntent().getExtras().getString(\"preference_key\")`\r\n  - By extending `AbstractPreferenceActivity`, there are built in methods to get and put values into `SharedPreferences`, play click/success sounds, and get the preference key (see [here](https://github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/blob/master/Library/src/com/victor/kaiser/pendergrast/settings/types/activity/AbstractPreferenceActivity.java))\r\n  - `HeadTiltPreferenceActivity` extends `AbstractPreferenceActivity`, so that may be helpful to look at\r\n 2. AbstractPreference\r\n  - Used to create completely custom Preference functionality\r\n  - See below for how to use\r\n\r\n## Creating Your Own Kinds of Preferences with AbstractPreference##\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of preference that you can make:\r\n  1. A preference that handles everything when it is tapped (See [TogglePreference](https://github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/blob/master/Library/src/com/victor/kaiser/pendergrast/settings/types/TogglePreference.java) and [ActivityPreference](https://github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/blob/master/Library/src/com/victor/kaiser/pendergrast/settings/types/ActivityPreference.java))\r\n  2. A preference that shows a series of choices when it is tapped (See [ChooserPreference](https://github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/blob/master/Library/src/com/victor/kaiser/pendergrast/settings/types/ChooserPreference.java))\r\n\r\n- Create a class that extends `AbstractPreference`\r\n- Create constructors\r\n- Override `getCard()`. This is where you will create the `View` for your preference. `getCard()` is called every time *GlassSettings* thinks that your preference's `View` might have to be updated\r\n- Override `onSelect()`:\r\n    - If you're building something like [TogglePreference](https://github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/blob/master/Library/src/com/victor/kaiser/pendergrast/settings/types/TogglePreference.java), then add all your functionality here and return `true` (indicating that everything is done). You can leave `getOptions()` and `onOptionsItemSelected()` alone\r\n    - If you're building something more like [ChooserPreference](https://github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/blob/master/Library/src/com/victor/kaiser/pendergrast/settings/types/ChooserPreference.java), in `onSelect()` return `false` and add functionality to `getOptions()` and `onOptionsItemSelected(int)`\r\n        - The `List` returned by `getOptions()` will be used to populate an `OptionsMenu`\r\n        - If an item is selected in the `OptionsMenu`, then `onOptionsItemSelected(int)` will be called with the index of the selected item\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it! \r\n\r\n## Contact and Future Development ##\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to reach me at <v.kaiser.pendergrast@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nThis library is still in a very early stage, so expect to see frequent updates with more kinds of preferences and additional functionality (perhaps the ability to define preference screens in XML).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots ##\r\nToggle Preference Unchecked:\r\n\r\n![Unchecked Toggle](http://raw2.github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/master/Screenshots/screen1.png)\r\n\r\nToggle Preference Checked:\r\n\r\n![Checked Toggle](http://raw2.github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/master/Screenshots/screen2.png)\r\n\r\nChoice Preference:\r\n\r\n![Choice Preference](http://raw2.github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/master/Screenshots/screen3.png)\r\n\r\nChoice Preference Tapped:\r\n\r\n![Tapped Choice Preference](http://raw2.github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/master/Screenshots/screen4.png)\r\n\r\nChoice Preference After Selection:\r\n\r\n![Unchecked](http://raw2.github.com/victorkp/GlassSettings/master/Screenshots/screen5.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
